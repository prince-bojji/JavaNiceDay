## Exercise 1

### Mortgage Calculator

```bash
Principal (1k - 1m): 100000
Annual Interest Rate (1 - 30): 3
Period (years) (1 - 30): 30
Mortgage: $472.81
```

Formula: M = P [ i (1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n – 1]

Here’s a breakdown of each of the variables:

- M = Total monthly payment
- P = The total amount of your loan
- I = Your interest rate, as a monthly percentage
- N = The total amount of months in your timeline for paying off your mortgage
