# Generics

___Generics___ allow you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with any type, while ensuring type safety at compile time. They enable you to specify a placeholder for a type that will be determined when the code is used.

### Syntax:
```bash
class ClassName<T> {
    // T is a type parameter that can be replaced with any actual type
    T variableName;

    T methodName(T param) {
        // Method body
    }
}
```
