# Collections

The **_Collection APIs_** provide a set of interfaces and classes to represent groups of objects, known as collections, and manipulate them in a standardized way. Collections allow you to `store`, `retrieve`, `manipulate`, and `process` data efficiently. The Collection framework includes interfaces like `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and their implementing classes like `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, etc.

### Collection Interfaces

1. **_List_** Ordered collection of elements that allows duplicate elements. Examples: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`.

2. **_Set_** Unordered collection of unique elements. Examples: `HashSet`, `TreeSet`.

3. **_Map_** Key-value pairs where each key is associated with exactly one value. Examples: `HashMap`, `TreeMap`.
