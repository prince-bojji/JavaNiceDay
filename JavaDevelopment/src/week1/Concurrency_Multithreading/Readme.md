# Concurrency APIs and Multi-threading

### Multi-Threading

___Multi-threading___ allows programs to execute multiple tasks concurrently, enabling better utilization of resources and improving performance.

[Sample Multi-Threading Implementation](https://github.com/prince-bojji/JavaNiceDay/tree/main/JavaDevelopment/src/week1/Concurrency_Multithreading/UsingThread.java)

### Concurrency APIs

Java provides higher-level ___Concurrency APIs___ to simplify multi-threaded programming, such as `ExecutorService`, `Future`, etc.
